# Diagnosis of bug:

The bug is that there is left over code that was originally being used to stop the Forward click event on the Inspect Icon check box. It seems that when the Forward click was patched the old code was not removed and related functions where not updated to use the correct new function calls. (https://github.com/firefox-devtools/reps/issues/95)

The what the benefit of fixing this bug will be to remove unused code that could cause confusion or unexpected error due to someone accidently using this incorrect code in another function that expands or modifies the functionalities present in the Forward click event issue 

# Propose a solution:

1. safely remove all code old code outlined in onGridCheckboxClick() function , that is not used anymore  [devtools/client/inspector/grids/components/GridItem.js#73-80](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/01b4b3830ea3cae2e9e431019afa6391b471c6da/devtools/client/inspector/grids/components/GridItem.js#73-80)

2. make the appropriate changes to in the render function so that onInspectIconClick make the correct call to `stopPropagation` 

# Testing:

open a new tab with this as a URL:

```
data:text/html,<meta charset=utf8><style>html {display: grid;}</style><html>hello</html>
```

Then, open the inspector, select the layout pane, expand the "grid" section if it's not expanded.
You should see an checkbox with an `html` label, and an icon right next to it (see attachment).
Clicking on the icon shouldn't check the checkbox.
